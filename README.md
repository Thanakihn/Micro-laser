# Micro-laser
Working on interfacing an interferometer for a science fair

This project is mainly oriented around interfacing 3 tools:
 - A USB cam√©ra : UI-3240LE-M-GL from iDS
 - A stepper USB : TMCM-1110 StepRocker
 - A piezo-electric system controled by a MDT694B from ThorLabs


Once we will be able to control those elements, we want to make a
micro-interferometer.
